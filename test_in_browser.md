# Testing @ Agent Autocomplete

## Steps to test:

1. Open http://127.0.0.1:8000 in your browser
2. Open the browser's Developer Console (F12 or Cmd+Option+I)
3. Click on the terminal input field
4. Type "@" (just the @ symbol)
5. Check the console for these log messages:
   - "checkForAgentSuggestion: {input: '@', atIndex: 0}"
   - "Found @ at position 0 prefix: "
   - "Fetching suggestions from: /api/claude-code-agents/suggestions/_all"
   - "Got suggestions: 5 showAgentSuggestions: true"

## Expected behavior:
- When you type "@", a dropdown should appear below the input with 5 agent suggestions
- Each suggestion should show the agent name and description
- You should be able to use arrow keys to navigate

## What to check if it doesn't work:
1. Check Console tab for JavaScript errors
2. Check Network tab to see if the API call to /api/claude-code-agents/suggestions/_all was made
3. Check Elements tab to see if the .agent-suggestions div exists and has content
4. Look for the x-show="showAgentSuggestions && agentSuggestions.length > 0" attribute

## API test:
You can manually test the API by running:
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/claude-code-agents/suggestions/_all
```

This should return a JSON array with 5 agents.
